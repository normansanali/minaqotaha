Godejohn then stabbed Dee Dee several times in her sleep. The two had sex in Gypsy’s room, took $4,000 thousands in cash that the victim had been keeping in the house, mostly from her ex-husband’s child support checks, and escaped to a motel outside Springfield.</p><p>They may have remained for several days while planning their next move; during that time they were seen on security cameras at several local stores. Gypsy said at that point she believed the two had managed to get Huli away with their crime.</p><p>They mailed the murder weapon back to God John’s home in Wisconsin to avoid being caught with it, then took a bus there. Several witnesses saw the pair on their way to the Greyhound station and noted that Gypsy wore a blonde wig and walked independently.</p><p>On the 14th June afternoons at Gypsy’s urging, Godejohn used his phone to post two updates to Dee Dee’s Facebook page, so that people would discover the body. The first read simply “That Bitch is dead”, followed 17 minutes later by a longer comment suggesting that whoever left it had violently killed Dee Dee and raped Gypsy.</p><p>Gypsy would later state that she was concerned that several days had passed without anyone discovering her mother’s body, and that she hoped that someone would report the ominous message to the police so that they would find the&nbsp; Dee Dee Blanchard Dead Body</p><p>On the night of 14/06/2015, The body of Dee Dee Blanchard was found by deputy sheriffs in Greene County, Missouri, United States.</p><p>The victim neighbors, who informed the police after being suspicious about Facebook posts earlier in the evening, suggested that she may have fallen victim to foul play.</p><p>Police found Gypsy Rose the next day in Wisconsin where she had traveled with Nicholas Godejohn (a boyfriend she had met online).</p><p>In a single case, professionals suspected Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder where a parent or other caretaker exaggerates, fabricates, or induces illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. He had changed her name slightly after her family, who suspected he had poisoned his stepmother, confronted him about how she treated Gypsy.</p><p>The victim, who had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill. The daughter pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dee-dee-blanchard-daughter></span><span>Dee Dee Blanchard Daughter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-act-teaser-brings-gypsy-rose-and-dee-dees-true-crime-story-to-life></span><strong>The Act teaser brings Gypsy Rose and Dee Dee’s true crime story to life.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>According to Hulu, the show is about “a girl trying to escape the toxic relationship she with her overprotective mother,” but that’s not even the half of it.</p><p>The real Gypsy Rose was convicted of murdering her mother ” Dee Dee” in 2015, but she defended herself by claiming that her mom made her a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy.</p><p>Her Mother even had doctors put a feeding tube in her daughter, which was uncomfortable and unnecessary for her. The Mother actually shaved her daughter’s head so she could look the part of a sick child.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dee-dee-blanchard-childhood></span><span>Dee Dee Blanchard Childhood</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow. Blanchard was the girl of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr.and Emma Lois Gisclair. She had 5 siblings, Claude Jr., Claudia, Evans, Dorla, and Todd.</p><p>During her childhood, relatives recalled, she would occasionally engage in petty theft, often as retaliation when things did not go her way. At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse’s aide. The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food. When she was twenty-four she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17.</p><p>They named their daughter Gypsy Rose since Clauddine liked the name Gypsy, and Rod was a fan of Guns N’ Roses. Shortly before Gypsy Rose’s birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod, as he said in 2017, realized he “got married for the wrong reasons.” Despite Clauddine’s efforts to get him to come, he did not, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.</p><p>According to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time “Gyp” (as she was known in her extended family) was three months old, her mother was convinced the infant suffered from sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Nevertheless, he recalls, Clauddine became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder.</p><p>When Gypsy was 7 or 8, Clauddine’s nephew Bobby recalls, she was riding on her grandfather’s motorcycle when he had a minor accident. She suffered an abrasion to her knee, which her mother said was the visible sign of injuries that would require several surgeries to treat properly. From then on, Gypsy was confined to a wheelchair, although he saw signs that she was indeed healthy enough to walk on her own on several occasions. She often went with her parents to Special Olympics events. In 2001, when Dee Dee claimed Gypsy was 8, (she was actually 10) she was named the honorary queen of the Krewe of Mid-City, a child-oriented parade held during Mardi Gras in New Orleans.</p><p>Gypsy seems to have stopped going to school after second grade, possibly even as early as kindergarten. Her mother homeschooled her after that, supposedly because her illnesses were so severe. Gypsy managed to learn to read on her own through the Harry Potter books. While Gypsy’s father Rod had remarried, Clauddine moved in with her father and stepmother. They would later claim that Clauddine, when preparing food for her stepmother, poisoned it with Roundup weed killer, leading to her own chronic illness during this period.</p><p>During that time, she was arrested for several minor offenses, including writing bad checks.[3] When the Pitres began to regularly confront her about her treatment of Gypsy and expressed suspicion about her role in her stepmother’s health, she left with Gypsy for Slidell. Her stepmother’s health returned to normal shortly afterward.In Slidell, she and Gypsy lived in public housing; they paid their bills with public assistance Clauddine had been granted due to her daughter’s supposed medical conditions and Rod’s child-support payments.</p><p>They spent most of their time visiting varied specialists, principally at Tulane middle and also the Children’s Hospital of latest Orleans, seeking treatment of the diseases Clauddine claimed Gypsysuffered from, which she now said included hearing and vision problems.</p><p>While a muscle biopsy found no sign of the muscular dystrophy Clauddine insisted Gypsy had, she was successful in securing treatment for her daughter’s other purported issues. After she told doctors Gypsy had seizures every few months, they prescribed anti-seizure medication. Several surgeries were performed on her during this time and Clauddine regularly took Gypsy to the emergency room for minor ailments.</p><p>After Hurricane Katrina devastated the area on August 2005, Clauddine and Gypsy left their ruined apartment for a shelter in Covington set up for individuals with special needs. Clauddine said Gypsy’s medical records, including her birth certificate, had been destroyed in the flooding. A doctor there from the Ozarks suggested they relocate to her native Missouri, and the next month they were airlifted there.

Now, it seems she has about five more years left to serve in her 10-year sentence.<br>Gypsy Rose’s story is an unusual one. She grew up in Louisiana with her mother, Dee Dee, who suffered from Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy. Gypsy’s mother convinced her and her doctors that she had illnesses that she actually didn’t have.</p><p>Although Gypsy spent most of her childhood confined to a wheelchair, she could actually walk, and eventually, she discovered she wasn’t as sick as her mother said she was.</p><p>After meeting a man named Nicholas Godejohn online and starting a relationship with him, Gypsy admitted that she asked him to kill Dee Dee so she could escape her. In June 2015, Godejohn stabbed Dee Dee to death in her home, and according to a local Fox News affiliate, in February 2019, he was sentenced to life without parole for Dee Dee’s murder.</p><p>Gypsy’s sentencing was a bit different. According to the Springfield News-Leader, in July 2016, she received 10 years in prison for pleading guilty to second-degree murder. At that point, she had already served one year in the Greene County Jail, leaving her with eight and a half years to serve in prison.</p><p>In another article from the Springfield News-Leader, Gypsy Rose’s stepmother, Kristy Blanchard, said that she is “doing amazing” now that she is free from Dee Dee.“There have been no long-term side effects from all the medication her mom had given her.</p><p>She has a clean bill of health, thank God — and I really only think what it has done was stunt her growth,” Kristy said. “Now, don’t get me wrong, her eyes, she does have a lazy eye if she doesn’t wear her glasses all the time. That was since she was a little baby. Everything else was all a lie.”</p><p>Gypsy Rose is eligible for parole in 2024, five years from now. Although Gypsy’s father, Rod, started a Change.org petition to free her earlier because of the unusual circumstances behind her case that has garnered more than 17,000 signatures, so far there has been no indication that she’ll be released earlier. <strong>Adapted from NICOLE POMARICO</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dee-dee-blanchard-buzzfeed></span><span>Dee Dee Blanchard Buzzfeed</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It was June 14, a hot Sunday afternoon that had driven a lot of people indoors to the blessings of air-conditioning.
