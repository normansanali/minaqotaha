No make-believe monster will ever match the ferocity of murderers like Ed Kemper, who killed 10 people in California, including his own mother, or Belle Gunness, who lured hopeful bachelors to her Indiana farm only to murder them and feed them to her pigs.</p><p>So, who is history’s worst serial killer? There are certainly many candidates, including Luis Garavito. The so-called “Beast” of Colombia, Garavito murdered anywhere from 100 to 400 boys, all between the ages of six and 16, and he may be the most prolific serial killer in human history.</p><p>Then again, there are other depraved serial killers, such as Gary Ridgway. Between 1982 and 1998, he targeted women in Washington State as the so-called “Green River Killer,” killing as many as 71 people before he was caught. By some estimates, Ridgeway is the worst serial killer in U.S. history, though his record may be surpassed by the prolific murderer Samuel Little.</p><p>Still, though Ridgway or Little may be the deadliest serial killers that America has ever seen, many believe that the “worst serial killer” title surely belongs to Ted Bundy. While Bundy didn’t have quite as high of a kill count —&nbsp;he murdered an estimated 30 women in the 1970s — his ferocity toward his victims has made him one of the most infamous criminals of all time.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i><h2 class=title>Edmund Kemper</h2><span class=caption-body><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edmund Kemper</a>'s murders began in 1964 when, at 15, he killed his own grandparents, saying he "just wanted to see what it felt like to kill Grandma." Released in 1969, Kemper soon terrorized California, raping, murdering, and desecrating the corpses of eight women. One of his victims was his own mother, whom he bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer before defiling her severed head. Surprisingly, Kemper soon turned himself in to the police. He was ultimately sentenced to life in prison, where he remains to this day.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Rodney Alcala</h2><span class=caption-body>Rodney James Alcala was a lady-killer — in more ways than one. The outwardly charming Alcala landed a spot on The Dating Game in 1978 while in the middle of his murder spree, later earning him the nickname "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dating Game Killer</a>." Alcala was eventually convicted of murdering six women and a teenage girl, and he was given the death sentence in California for his crimes. The killer ended up dying of natural causes while behind bars, but not before suggesting that he'd actually killed somewhere between 50 and 100 people.</span><span class=credit>Bettmann/Contributor/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Leonarda Cianciulli</h2><span class=caption-body><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonarda Cianciulli</a> murdered three women in Italy in 1939 and 1940 — and turned their bodies into soap and teacakes. Her murder spree started after a visit to a fortune teller left her convinced that she had to perform human sacrifices to keep her son alive as he fought during World War II. She killed three women, dismembered their bodies, and used their remains in teacakes and soap, which she later gifted to her friends. Her sloppy third murder led to her getting caught by the authorities, who would later sentence her to 30 years in a prison and three years in a criminal asylum. She died in the asylum.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Nannie Doss</h2><span class=caption-body>From the 1920s to the 1950s, Nannie Doss, a.k.a. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Giggling Granny</a>," murdered several of her own family members. She killed four husbands, two children, two sisters, her mother, two grandsons, and a mother-in-law. When she was finally caught, Doss could hardly talk about the murders without cracking a smile and laughing, hence her bone-chilling nickname.</span><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Pedro Rodrigues Filho</h2><span class=caption-body>By the time he was 18, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pedro Rodrigues Filho</a> had already committed 10 murders in his native Brazil. He was just getting started, though — he would kill at least 71 total before he was arrested in 1973. But Filho lived by a code: He only went after criminals and those who had personally wronged him. That included his own father. When Filho found out his father had killed his mother, he cut out his heart and ate it. Because of this, he's sometimes called the "Brazilian Dexter." After serving 34 years in prison, he was released in 2007 and became something of an anti-crime crusader before being gunned down by an unknown assailant in 2023.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Gilles De Rais</h2><span class=caption-body>French nobleman <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gilles de Rais</a> was considered a hero for his service in the military alongside Joan of Arc — until the world found out that he had murdered more than 100 children in the early 1400s. De Rais is believed to have kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and mutilated young peasant boys in his attempt to summon demons. He was hanged for his crimes in 1440.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Richard Chase</h2><span class=caption-body>Even among serial killers, Richard Chase's story is especially disturbing. Dubbed "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Vampire of Sacramento</a>," Chase killed at least six people in California in the 1970s — but he didn't stop there. After they'd died, he defiled their bodies, drank their blood, and ate their internal organs. Ultimately, Chase was caught and sentenced to death by gas chamber, but he ultimately killed himself in prison in 1980.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Pedro Lopez</h2><span class=caption-body>The "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster of the Andes</a>," Pedro Lopez was convicted of killing 110 girls, but some criminologists believe he may have killed as many as 300. Lopez traveled between Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador throughout the late 1970s and 1980, targeting street children and members of Indigenous tribes and then raping and murdering his victims. But the most disturbing part of this story is the aftermath. Not only was he released early from prison in Ecuador in 1994 for "good behavior," but he was later released from a psychiatric hospital in Colombia in 1998 after being declared sane.

Between 1992 and 1999, Garavito preyed upon street children in his native Colombia, most of them orphans who had lost their parents in the country's civil war. He also targeted victims in other South American countries. Eventually caught in 1999, Garavito was found to have murdered anywhere from 100 to 400 boys. Though he was initially sentenced to 1,853 years in prison, this sentence has been reduced multiple times due to term limits and Garavito's cooperation with the police. Shockingly, he will be up for parole in 2023.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Andrei Chikatilo</h2><span class=caption-body>Known as Russia’s “Red Ripper,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrei Chikatilo</a> murdered up to 56 women and children between 1978 and 1990.

And Bundy didn't stop when his victims were dead — he liked to decapitate them and have sex with their remains. This grisly murderer eluded law enforcement for years, even escaping from custody twice and going on to kill again. But finally, in 1978, a captured Bundy was put behind bars for good.

Neither his coworkers nor his wife of 31 years ever could have imagined that he was living a double life, torturing and murdering at least three women who worked as house cleaners between 2005 and 2008. His secret life was revealed when police connected his DNA to semen at the scene of one of his crimes.

Golovkin, wanting to prolong his victims' suffering, turned his basement workshop into a dungeon. There, he could torture his victims for as long as he wanted before killing them.

But it was the work of a single man: <a href=# rel=noopener>Luis Garavito</a>. And the corpses in that grave made up just a small portion of his hundreds of alleged victims.</p><p>Born in 1957, Garavito and his brothers were allegedly abused by their father. And as an adult, Garavito started abusing young boys himself. He targeted homeless and orphaned young boys, many of whom had ended up on the streets because of a decades-long civil war that tore through Colombia.</p><p>Garavito preyed on hundreds of boys across dozens of Colombian towns, though he focused largely on Pereira. There, he often disguised himself as a priest, farmer, elderly man, or street vendor, and lured in his unsuspecting victims with promises of money, candy, or employment.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-444299 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/luis-garavito-mugshot.jpeg alt="Worst Serial Killers" width=800 height=858 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-444299 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>Luis Garavito, who may have killed as many as 400 children, is widely considered one of the worst serial killers in history.</span></p><p>Once he got them away from the crowds, Garavito earned their trust by asking them questions about their lives.

He'd tie them up, rape them, bite them, and sometimes cut off their genitals.</p><p>By the time he was arrested in 1999, Luis Garavito had brutalized hundreds of victims. He confessed to killing 147 boys, and drew maps to lead police officers to their bodies, but Colombian authorities suspect that Garavito's victim count is much higher. In fact, he may have killed as many as 400.</p><p>That makes Luis Garavito one of the world's worst serial killers, judging by the jaw-dropping number of his victims. But in the United States specifically, that title belongs to another murderous monster.</p><h2>The Horrifying Crimes Of The "Green River Killer"</h2><p>In the United States, the worst serial killer may be <a href=# rel=noopener>Gary Ridgway</a>, who is commonly known as the "Green River Killer." Between 1982 and 1998, he murdered at least 49 women and girls in and around Washington State —&nbsp;but may have actually killed more than 90 victims total.</p><p>Born in 1949, Ridgway had a seemingly normal childhood marred by his chronic bed-wetting. His mother reportedly washed his genitals after these incidents, which is why some psychologists believe Ridgway developed a deep hatred of his mother (who escaped his killing spree) and other women.</p><p>After stabbing a boy at the age of 15 just to see how stabbing "worked," Ridgway became a murderous adult who targeted vulnerable women and girls. He started killing in 1982 by murdering 16-year-old Wendy Lee Coffield, a foster home runaway, and his crimes rapidly escalated from there.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-339561 alt="The Green River Killer" width=900 height=653 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gary-ridgway-the-green-river-killer.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-339561 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Gary Ridgway was sentenced to life in prison in 2003, after narrowly avoiding the death penalty.</span></p><p>Ridgway often targeted runaways and sex workers, who he usually picked up at bars or truck stops along Highway 99 outside of Seattle. He would try to earn his victims' trust by talking about his son. Then, Ridgway would have seemingly normal sex with them before strangling them to death and then dumping their bodies, typically near the Green River.</p><p>By the time he was finally arrested in 2001, Ridgway had reportedly lost count of his victims. He was eventually convicted of 49 murders, but he confessed to 71, and he may have killed even more people. "I killed so many women, I have a hard time keeping them straight," Ridgway <a href=# rel=noopener>admitted</a>.</p><p>Gary Ridgway is certainly one of America's worst serial killers and has long been considered the most prolific murderer in the country. But there's another killer who might have gruesomely outdone him: <a href=# rel=noopener>Samuel Little</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-243137 alt="Samuel Little" width=800 height=671 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/little-with-his-lawyer.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-243137 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Samuel Little being convicted of murder on September 2, 2014, in Los Angeles Superior Court.</span></p><p>Little confessed to killing 93 women between 1970 and 2005 across multiple states, and the FBI was able to verify that he'd been involved in the deaths of at least 60 of his alleged victims. Eerily, the authorities were able to confirm many of Little's kills thanks to drawings he'd made of his victims.</p><p>When it comes to the worst serial killer in the United States, then, both Gary Ridgway and Samuel Little are potential candidates given their large (and somewhat vague) number of victims. But based on notoriety alone, the worst killer in the United States might be Ted Bundy.</p><h2>Ted Bundy: One Of America's Worst Serial Killers</h2><p>All of the killers in the gallery above murdered people in horrible, gruesome ways. But <a href=# rel=noopener>Ted Bundy</a> stands apart for the depraved ways he slaughtered his victims. In just four years between 1974 and 1978, Bundy raped and murdered dozens of women across multiple states. He confessed to killing 30 young women and girls, but his true victim count could be much higher.</p><p>Bundy, who was born in 1946 and had a turbulent childhood, attacked his first known victim in 1974. Then, he broke into the apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks in Washington State and bludgeoned and sexually assaulted her with a metal rod from her bed frame. Sparks survived the brutal attack — just barely — but Bundy's future victims would not be so lucky.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-147204 alt="Ted Bundy" width=900 height=693 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ted-bundy-in-court-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-147204 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Contributor/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Ted Bundy waves to television cameras during his trial for the assault and murder of several women in Florida in 1978.</span></p><p>He continued attacking young women in Washington and Oregon, often luring them in by pretending to struggle with crutches or a stack of books near <a href=# rel=noopener>his infamous Volkswagen Beetle</a>, before he left to study at the University of Utah. There, Bundy continued to kill, often targeting teen girls.</p><p>While traveling to other states like Idaho and Colorado, Ted Bundy continued his spree. Arrested in 1975, he was able to escape from prison twice —&nbsp;murdering more victims while on the run —&nbsp;before his final arrest in 1978 ensured that he'd never walk free again. One investigator noted: "I would describe him being as close to being like the devil as anyone I ever met."</p><p>But Ted Bundy, Gary Ridgway, and Luis Garavito are just a few of the world's worst serial killers.
