Jennifer Lopez began appearing as a “Fly Girl” dancer in 1991 on “In Living Color”. There, she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Jennifer Lopez’s full name is Jennifer Lynn Lopez and she was born on<strong> July 24, 1969</strong>. She is currently <strong>53 years old</strong> and her zodiac is Leo. She is originally from The Bronx borough of New York City and her parents are Puerto Rican.</p><p>Her mother is Guadalupe Rodríguez and her father is David López. Lopez has an older sister named Leslie, and a younger sister named Lynda, who is a journalist.</p><p>Her father worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while her mother was a homemaker. When she was born, the family was living in a small apartment in the Castle Hill neighborhood.</p><p>After a few years, her parents had saved up enough money to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.</p><p>At the age of five, she began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was only seven years old. Additionally, her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English.</p><p>They encouraged all three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay “out of trouble”.</p><p>She spent her entire academic career in Catholic schools, finishing at Preston High School. While at school, she did gymnastics and ran track on a national level. She was also a member of the school’s softball team.</p><p>Rather than academically, J.Lo. excelled athletically, competing in national track championships. After high school, she attended Baruch College for just one semester.</p><p>Moreover, her nicknames include J. Lo, La Lopez, Lola, Jenny from the Block, La Guitarra, and La diva del Bronx. She is an American whereas her ethnic background is Puerto Rican.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-31583 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Lopez-with-her-sisters.jpg alt="Jennifer Lopez" width=650 height=956 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-31583 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jennifer Lopez with her sisters Leslie and Lynda.

Alex is an American former professional baseball shortstop and third baseman who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball.</p><p>Going through the details of the lovebirds’ relationship, they were first spotted together in February 2017. A year after their engagement, the retired athlete, Alex, took to Instagram to reminisce on the fairy-tale moment he proposed to Lopez.</p><p>Alex posted a sweet video montage of his favorite memories with the Hustlers star and captioned the post:</p><p>“One year ago on a beach in the Bahamas…. I was a nervous wreck, more nervous than my entire playing career, I got down on one knee and asked you a question… you said yes. Jennifer, every moment with you is a blessing. You are my best friend, my inspiration, an amazing mother, and a role model to all. Macha, I am so lucky to be with you. Thank you for making my life better. I can’t wait to make more memories with you. I love you. #HappyAnniversary.”</p><p>Before all these, the twosome was first spotted together at a Yankee game in May 2005. This was when J.Lo. attended the game with her then-husband, Marc Anthony.</p><p>More than a decade later, in March 2017, Lopez and Rodriguez were dating! Lopez spoke publicly about her relationship with the former MLB star during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in April 2017.</p><p>Later, the couple&nbsp;made their red carpet debut&nbsp;at the 2017 Met Gala in New York City.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-31581 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Lopez-with-Alex-Rodriguez-and-his-daughters.jpg alt="Jennifer Lopez" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-31581 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jennifer Lopez and her Fiancee Alex Rodriguez with his daughters.
