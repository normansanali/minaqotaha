Why did we risk it all?' she writes in real-time. 'That answer is simple. We were being hunted.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Beginning at a very young age, Cheryl noticed that her father, George, checked into hotels under different last names. 'Most often Cash, Sterling, and Gold, my father seemed to like money-related names.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was never clear where their money came from, she said, 'I'm taught to shoplift, but that's just to build character.'

'Since Dad considers all educational institutions breeding grounds for government propaganda and square-thinking bureaucrats.'

Her family moved into a grand secluded two-story mansion which they furnished with plastic outdoor patio furniture, that 'seemed like a good temporary option when we moved in.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She recalls the awkward practice of meeting kids her age for the first time, 'Why is it that the more ordinary a situation is, the more it paralyzes me with anxiety?'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But for a brief moment, Cheryl got to experience a standard childhood: she was involved in competitive swimming and gymnastics, she enrolled in a puppet theatre group, joined an abacus club and took a children's art class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She didn't take any of it for granted. 'For the rest, there will always be next summer, next year,' she said. 'For us, everything we are tasting maybe for the last time.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A few weeks later, clothes, books, and toys were scattered on the floor as her family frantically packed their suitcases. George's Vancouver business partner in a get-rich-quick scheme started asking too many questions, and spooked the family when he showed up at their front door demanding answers earlier that evening.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By 4am, Diamond said, 'it looked like a tornado had torn through our house.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The drill was always the same: destroy all evidence of life, wipe finger prints and change names.
